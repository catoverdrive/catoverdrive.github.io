<h2>Getting There</h2>

The Institute of Contemporary Art is located at 25 Harbor Shore Drive, Boston, MA.

<h3>Public Transit</h3>
The ICA is approximately 5 minutes away from the Courthouse stop on the Silver Line. From
South Station, the SL1, SL2, SL3, and SLW will stop at Courthouse. SL4 and SL5 go in the other 
direction and will not get you there. From the airport, take the SL1 (the only one that 
stops at the airport).

<h3>Driving and Parking</h3>
There is a parking lot across the street from the ICA, and it costs $17 after 5pm. We do, 
however, strongly encourage you to find alternative transportation.

<p>We have a block of rooms at the <a href="https://www.seaportboston.com/">Boston Seaport Hotel</a> 
for $229 a night. In order to make a reservation, please call the hotel at 1-877-SEAPORT 
and request the group rate for the <b>Wang &amp; Myers Wedding</b> Room Block.</p>

<p>The last day to make a reservation with the group discount is July 6th. As a heads up, 
we pretty strongly suggest that you book a hotel room sooner rather than later; Boston 
Comic Con is happening that weekend right down the street, and we expect that hotels may 
book up as the date gets closer.</p>

<p>The hotel is at the third-floor exit of the World Trade Center stop on the Silver Line
(SL1, SL2, and SL3). It is a five to seven minute walk from the ICA, although we will 
likely be running shuttles to and from the venue.</p>
