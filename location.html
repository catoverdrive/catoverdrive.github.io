<h2>Getting There</h2>

The Institute of Contemporary Art is located at 25 Harbor Shore Drive, Boston, MA.

<h3>Public Transit</h3>
The ICA is approximately 5 minutes away from the Courthouse stop on the Silver Line. From South Station, the SL1, SL2, SL3, and SLW will stop at Courthouse. SL4 and SL5 go in the other direction and will not get you there. From the airport, take the SL1 (the only one that stops at the airport).

<h3>Driving</h3>
We're not really sure about the driving directions to the venue, but we suspect that parking is expensive and a pain, and would suggest against it.

<h2>Lodging</h2>
We plan on acquiring hotel blocks for anyone coming from out of town. They'll be within walking distance of the venue. We'll update this page once we finalize the details.
