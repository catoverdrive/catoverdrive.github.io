<p>
We're still getting married! Although the pandemic has postponed many of 
our plans, it hasn't postponed our love for each other. We'll be getting
married on Sunday, December 27, 2020 in a small ceremony in northern Maine, 
and we would love it if you joined us (virtually!) for the ceremony. We 
look forward to celebrating with everyone in person once we know that 
it's safe to do so!
